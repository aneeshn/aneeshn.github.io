### Abstract

In this post I am trying to answer the question `can I learn in a compressed state space?`

What if we are able to reduce the state space we need to explore and learn in ? If so can we transfer the skills we have learnt in this small domain and apply it to a more complex domain? Before I explain why this is important, let me illustrate the point that I am trying to make.
