I am interested in studying and building AI systems that can collaborate with Humans. How do we measure the success of collaboration? How do we get these AI agents into the real world? What should we watch out for when building such systems? How can we build safe and reliable AI agents?

I am currently working as a software engineer at Amazon in Cape Town, South Africa. Before joining Amazon I worked as a Machine learning engineer at takealot.com. I enjoy building ml solutions from scratch and building the architecture required to serve it at scale.
